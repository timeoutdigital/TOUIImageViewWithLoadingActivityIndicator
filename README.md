TOUIImageViewWithLoadingActivityIndicator
=========================================

A subclassed UIImageView which, whenever there is no image assigned to the view will display a centered loading activity indicator, which we find useful when you are pulling images from a slow source such as a remote server. 

To use, just add the repository as a git submodule then drag the directory TOUIImageViewWithLoadingActivityIndicator into your project.

There is an example project and unit tests included.
